## ParrotFarm
ParrotFarm is a fully-featured Behavior-Driven-Developed Ruby on Rails app with AngularJS as a front-end framework.

#### Technologies included
* Ruby on Rails
* AngularJS
* SASS
* Slim
* CoffeeScript
* Bootstrap 3 (4 is still in alpha)
* RSpec & Capybara

### Why?
This app is originally crafted as my skills showcase, but you might use it as you want, presumably for learning how-to Angular plus Rails. ParrotFarm utilizes edge versions of everything (expect sprockets, but there is an explanation for this), so it supposes to be a really modern tutorial.

### How to use
You can do whatever you want with this code. You can print it and feed your dog with it. You can copy it and make a lot of money selling it to parrot-breeders. You even can use it's code captions for your next school video (just imagine that).

Seriously, ParrotFarm is ready to be deployed to Heroku. Manual can be found here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4
